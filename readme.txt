About Plugin

Plugin allows you to make different split versions of your product and discover which one sells more. So you can optimize it !!

You can create as many split title versions of your products as you want.

Just create new title test version by duplicating original version, and publish it.
When user comes to your website, plugin randomly chose one title version for a product and shows it for the user everywhere (product list, product page.) instead of original version.

In your admin panel you will see how many times title test version replaced original product, how many sales made, and what is sales rate, so you can see which title performs best!
